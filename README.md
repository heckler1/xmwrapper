#XMWrapper
XMWrapper is a simple PowerShell wrapper for XMRig to run it as Administrator. Opening with PowerShell allows for a simple, user-friendly UAC prompt instead of trying to run as Administrator from a CMD prompt. It also improves on the .bat file approach by setting configuration values as variables, allowing for simpler, easier to read configuration of the miner.

To use just drop XMWrapper in the same directory as XMRig, set the configuration values in the script, and run it.
